# Machine-Learning
--------------------------------------

Machine Learning is a system of computer algorithms that can learn from example through self-improvement without being explicitly coded by a programmer. Machine learning is a part of artificial Intelligence which combines data with statistical tools to predict an output which can be used to make actionable insights.

Machine learning is also used for a variety of tasks like fraud detection, predictive maintenance, portfolio optimization, automatize task and so on.

The life of Machine Learning programs is straightforward and can be summarized in the following points:

  * Define a question
  * Collect data
  * Visualize data
  * Train algorithm
  * Test the Algorithm
  * Collect feedback
  * Refine the algorithm
  * Loop 4-7 until the results are satisfying
  * Use the model to make a prediction

Once the algorithm gets good at drawing the right conclusions, it applies that knowledge to new sets of data.

Machine learning can be grouped into two broad learning tasks: 
  
  1) Supervised
  2) Unsupervised

# Supervised Machine Learning
-------------------------------------

An algorithm uses training data and feedback from humans to learn the relationship of given inputs to a given output.We can use supervised learning when the output data is known. The algorithm will predict new data.

There are two categories of supervised learning:

  1) Classification task
  2) Regression task

# Unsupervised Machine Learning 
------------------------------------------------

In unsupervised learning, an algorithm explores input data without being given an explicit output variable (e.g., explores customer demographic data to identify patterns). We can use it when you do not know how to classify the data.
